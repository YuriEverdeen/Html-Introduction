    <h1>MY SKILLS</h1>

    
    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <p>
        Writing was one of my hobbies and something I considered a skill. Back then, I spent a lot of time writing short stories and poems. 
        For me, writing was a way to express my emotions when I found it difficult to say them out loud. 
        Whether I was feeling happy, sad, or confused, putting my thoughts down on paper helped me understand myself better. 
        Writing allowed me to be creative and honest, which made it a special part of my life.

    <h2>Pulic Speaking</h2>
    <p>
        To be honest, I’m a naturally shy person, but I believe that speaking in front of a crowd is one of my skills. It’s not something I’ve always focused on or tried to master, but I’ve had some experience with it.
         Back in school, I used to join oral poem competitions.  Those experiences helped me become more confident in speaking and improved my reading skills as well. 
         Even though I’m still shy, I’ve learned how to handle speaking in public better because of those opportunities.

    <h2>Self Motivation</h2>
    <p>
        I think self-motivation has become one of my skills. Lately, I’ve been using it to push myself to stay cheerful and positive, even when I face problems and difficulties. 
        No matter what challenges come my way, I remind myself to keep going and try to look on the bright side.
         It’s not always easy, but self-motivation helps me stay focused on the good things in life. 
    </p>
